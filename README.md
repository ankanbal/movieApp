## Movie Viewing MERN application

This project is a demonstration level work for a MERN stack development. I intend to make more changes in it (like adding user login/register and showing movie theatre names etc).

# How to use

1. Just download the project and go to server folder (first since backend needs to be started before frontend), open terminal and type nodemon index.js
2. After that go to client folder, open terminal and type npm start
3. Wait for a bit then you will see the UI for the project on the browser.

Won't explain how the UI will work since it will be obvious when you see it.

# Important note

One issue that I need to address is the need for the react-table-6 (it has to be version 6 or react-table.css won't load).
